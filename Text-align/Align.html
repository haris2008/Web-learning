      YouTube is one of the world’s largest online video-sharing platforms,
      founded in February 2005 by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim.
      Originally created as a simple site where people could upload and share
      home videos, YouTube quickly evolved into a global hub for entertainment,
      education, news, and creativity. After being acquired by Google in 2006,
      the platform expanded its infrastructure, introducing features like HD
      streaming, live broadcasts, monetization through ads, and membership
      programs.Today, YouTube serves over 2 billion logged-in users monthly,
      hosting content that spans virtually every topic imaginable — from
      tutorials, music videos, and gaming streams to podcasts, documentaries,
      and vlogs. Its recommendation algorithm plays a major role in shaping what
      viewers watch next, often using data from viewing history and engagement
      to keep audiences hooked.YouTube has also transformed careers: “YouTubers”
      have become modern-day celebrities, building massive audiences and earning
      revenue through ads, sponsorships, and fan memberships. The platform’s
      comment section, likes/dislikes, and community posts create an interactive
      experience that bridges creators and audiences around the world. In recent
      years, YouTube has expanded into short-form content with YouTube Shorts,
      rivaling TikTok, and into subscription-based services like YouTube Premium
      and YouTube Music, offering ad-free viewing and exclusive content. Despite
      facing challenges such as copyright disputes, misinformation, and content
      moderation, YouTube remains a cornerstone of the digital era — a place
      where anyone, anywhere, can share their voice and creativity with the
      world.
